# Automated-Report-Generation
Objective: Develop a Python script that reads data from a file (e.g., CSV), analyzes it, and generates a well-formatted PDF report.
What is Automated Report Generation?
Automated report generation is the process of using scripts or software tools to create comprehensive reports without manual intervention. These reports can summarize data, provide insights, and present visualizations in a structured and formatted document, such as a PDF or HTML file.

Why Automate Report Generation?
Time Efficiency: Saves time by automating repetitive tasks of data collection and formatting.
Consistency: Ensures all reports have a standardized format and structure.
Error Reduction: Minimizes the risk of human error during data analysis and report preparation.
Scalability: Handles large datasets and frequent reporting needs effortlessly.
How Automated Report Generation Works
Data Input:

Data is read from a source file such as a CSV, Excel, or database.
The pandas library is commonly used for data manipulation and analysis.
Data Analysis:

Perform calculations, such as totals, averages, and trends.
Summarize the data for easy understanding.
Data Visualization:

Create charts and graphs using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn.
Include visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, or pie charts for better presentation.
PDF Creation:

Use libraries such as FPDF, ReportLab, or PyPDF2 to create well-structured reports.
Include text, tables, images, and charts in the PDF.
Report Customization:

Add a title, logos, date, and any other relevant information.
Use consistent fonts, colors, and layouts to make the report professional.
Example Libraries for Report Generation
FPDF:

Simple and lightweight.
Ideal for creating custom PDFs with text, images, and tables.
ReportLab:

More feature-rich.
Allows for advanced layouts, styling, and complex PDF creation.
PyPDF2:

Focused on editing and combining PDFs rather than creating them from scratch.
Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Generate visualizations to embed in the report.
Example Use Cases
Sales Reports: Summarize revenue, profit, and trends.
Performance Dashboards: Display metrics like KPIs in graphs.
Project Summaries: Include milestones, progress, and outcomes.
Survey Results: Summarize responses and visualize data.

1. Importing Necessary Libraries
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
from fpdf import FPDF
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It helps read, process, and structure data from sources like CSV files.
fpdf: A library for creating PDF files. It allows adding text, tables, and images to a PDF document.
matplotlib.pyplot: Used for generating visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs) that can be embedded in the PDF.
2. Reading Data from a CSV File
python
Copy
Edit
data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')
The script reads the data from a file named sales_data.csv using the read_csv() function from pandas.
The data should contain columns like Product, Sales, and Profit.
Example CSV content:

csv
Copy
Edit
Product,Sales,Profit
Product A,1000,200
Product B,1500,300
Product C,800,150
Product D,1200,250
3. Generating a Sales Bar Chart
python
Copy
Edit
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(data['Product'], data['Sales'], color='skyblue')
plt.title('Sales by Product')
plt.xlabel('Product')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('sales_chart.png')
plt.close()
A bar chart is created to visualize sales for each product:
data['Product']: The x-axis represents product names.
data['Sales']: The y-axis represents sales values.
plt.savefig('sales_chart.png'): Saves the chart as an image (sales_chart.png) to embed it later in the PDF.
plt.close(): Closes the figure to free up memory.
4. Initializing the PDF
python
Copy
Edit
pdf = FPDF()
pdf.add_page()
pdf.set_font('Arial', size=12)
Creates a PDF object using FPDF.
Adds a new page (add_page()) and sets the font to Arial with a default size of 12.
5. Adding a Title to the PDF
python
Copy
Edit
pdf.set_font('Arial', 'B', 16)
pdf.cell(200, 10, txt="Sales Report", ln=True, align='C')
pdf.ln(10)
Sets the font to bold Arial, size 16 for the title.
pdf.cell(): Adds a text cell to the PDF:
Width (200) and height (10).
txt="Sales Report": Text to display.
ln=True: Moves to the next line after adding the text.
align='C': Centers the text.
6. Adding a Table of Data
python
Copy
Edit
pdf.set_font('Arial', size=12)
for i, row in data.iterrows():
    pdf.cell(60, 10, txt=row['Product'], border=1)
    pdf.cell(60, 10, txt=str(row['Sales']), border=1)
    pdf.cell(60, 10, txt=str(row['Profit']), border=1)
    pdf.ln()
Iterates over the rows of the data DataFrame using data.iterrows().
For each row:
pdf.cell(): Creates a table cell for Product, Sales, and Profit.
border=1: Adds a border around the cell.
ln(): Moves to the next line for the next row.
7. Embedding the Chart
python
Copy
Edit
pdf.image('sales_chart.png', x=50, y=None, w=100)
Adds the saved bar chart (sales_chart.png) to the PDF:
x=50: Horizontal position on the page.
y=None: Lets FPDF determine the vertical position automatically.
w=100: Width of the image in the PDF.
8. Saving the PDF
python
Copy
Edit
pdf.output('sales_report.pdf')
Saves the generated PDF as sales_report.pdf.
Final PDF Output
The PDF includes:

A title: "Sales Report".
A table listing products, their sales, and profits.
A bar chart visualizing sales by product.
How to Run the Code
Save the code as a Python script (e.g., generate_report.py).
Ensure you have:
The sales_data.csv file in the same directory as the script.
Necessary libraries installed (pip install pandas fpdf matplotlib).
Run the script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python generate_report.py
Open the generated sales_report.pdf to view the report.
